# Bite Clock - The Food Expiration Tracker

Bite Clock is a web application designed to help users manage their personal food inventory and reduce food waste by notifying them of upcoming expiration dates.

## MVP Features

- As a user, I want to sign up for an account so that I can securely manage my personal food inventory.
- As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my food inventory.
- As a user, I want to log out of my account so that I can ensure my account is secure when I'm not using it.
- As a user, I want to add food items to my inventory so that I can track what I have in stock.
- As a user, I want to update details of food items in my inventory so that I can keep my inventory accurate.
- As a user, I want to delete food items from my inventory so that I can remove items that I no longer have or need.
- As a user, I want to categorize my food items by location (fridge, shelf, pantry) so that I can organize my inventory more effectively.

## Stretch Goals

- As a user, I want to receive notifications when my food items are approaching their expiration dates so that I can use or consume them before they go bad.
- As a user, I want to see visualizations of my food inventory (e.g., pie charts of categories, bar graphs of expiring items) so that I can easily understand my stock levels and expiration trends.
